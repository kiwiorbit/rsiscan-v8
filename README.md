# Crypto RSI Scanner & Advanced Trading Tool

Crypto RSI Scanner is a comprehensive, real-time dashboard and analysis tool designed for cryptocurrency traders. It provides a powerful interface to monitor the Relative Strength Index (RSI), Stochastic RSI, WaveTrend, the proprietary KiwiHunt oscillator, and key volume metrics for hundreds of trading pairs from the Binance exchange.

What began as a simple RSI scanner has evolved into an advanced charting platform, complete with institutional-grade indicators like Volume Profile and advanced, strategy-based alerts, all within a sleek, customizable, and responsive web interface.
