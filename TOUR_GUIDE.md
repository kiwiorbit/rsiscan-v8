## Introduction & The "Why" (30 seconds)

**(Start on the main dashboard, RSI Chart View, 15m timeframe)**

"Good morning/afternoon, everyone. For any serious trader, the biggest challenge is cutting through the market noise to find genuine opportunities. You can spend hours manually flipping through charts, or you can use a tool that does the heavy lifting for you.

That's exactly what the Crypto RSI Scanner is. It's not just a dashboard; it's a real-time, institutional-grade analysis platform designed to turn raw market data into actionable intelligence. Today, I'll show you how it helps traders stop hunting for trades and lets the best opportunities come directly to them."

## Part 1: The Command Center - Your Market Overview (2 minutes)

**ACTION 1: Control the Timeframe**
1.  Click the **Timeframe Selector** in the header.
2.  Select `1h`. Watch the grid instantly refresh.

> **SAY:** "The most critical element for any analysis is the timeframe. With one click, we can instantly pivot our entire view of the market. Let's switch to the 1-hour chart to look for more stable trends."

**ACTION 2: Switch Views for Instant Insights**

2.  Point out the color variation.
3.  Click the **WaveTrend button** (`fa-water`).
4.  Click the **KiwiHunt button** (`fa-rocket`).
5.  Return to the **RSI Chart View** (`fa-chart-line`).

> **SAY:** "But we don't just have one way of looking at the market. Every trader has their preference, and this dashboard adapts.
>
> "For an instant sentiment gauge, we can switch to the **Heatmap view**. Here, deep green means 'extremely oversold' and bright red is 'extremely overbought'. We also have dedicated views for **Stochastics**, **WaveTrend**, our proprietary **KiwiHunt indicator** for spotting high-quality reversals, and of course, a simple **Price** view."

**ACTION 3: Filter and Find What Matters**

If we switch to the **WaveTrend view**, the same button now sorts by the WaveTrend oscillator, instantly bringing the most interesting setups to the top."

## Part 2: The Deep Dive - Granular Analysis (3 minutes)

We can also instantly overlay key **Fibonacci Levels** and, on higher timeframes, the **Previous Week's Price Levels**.
>
> "But where it gets really powerful is when we switch to our indicator charts. On the **WaveTrend chart**, you can see these green dots, which visually confirm high-conviction buy signals.

**ACTION 2: The "Wow" Moment - Copy to Clipboard**

## Part 4: The Automated Scout - The Alerting Engine (2 minutes)

"So far, we've shown how the app empowers *your* analysis. But what if the app could do the analysis *for* you, 24/7?"

**ACTION 1: Show the Alert Configuration**

2.  Click the **Gear icon** > **Configure Alerts**.
3.  Briefly click through the tabs, pausing on the **KiwiHunt** and **Indicator** tabs.

We see a 'KiwiHunt: Hunt Buy' alert here for `SOLUSDT` on the 1-hour timeframe. Instead of manually going to find that setup, you just... **(ACTION: Click the notification)**... and the app instantly takes you to the right symbol, on the right timeframe, and **opens the KiwiHunt chart directly.**
>
> "This is our 'Click-to-View' system. It takes you from signal to decision in one second."

## Part 5: Putting It All Together - Catching a Trade (2 minutes)

"So, we've received our 'KiwiHunt: Hunt Buy' alert for SOLUSDT. This is our signal. Now, let's validate it."

**ACTION 1: Analyze the Indicator & Switch to Price Action**
1.  You are already on the KiwiHunt modal from the previous step.
2.  Point to the green dot on the chart.
3.  Click the **Price Chart icon** (`fa-chart-area`) inside the modal.

> **SAY:** "The app brought us directly to the KiwiHunt chart, and we can see the exact moment the signal fired, confirmed by this green 'Hunt Buy' dot. This looks strong. But an indicator signal is only half the story. With one click... *(click price chart icon)* ...we can immediately see what the price was doing at that exact moment."

**ACTION 2: Build Confluence with Pro Tools**
1.  On the Price Chart, click the **Volume Profile button**. Point to the Value Area Low (VAL).
2.  Click the **Fibonacci Levels button**. Point to the Golden Pocket.

> **SAY:** "Now we build our case for the trade. First, let's turn on the **Volume Profile**. Look at that - the price is bouncing right off the Value Area Low. This is a key area of volume-based support.
>
> "Next, let's check the **Fibonacci Levels**. It's also bouncing perfectly from the Golden Pocket. We now have three powerful points of confluence: a strong KiwiHunt buy signal, a bounce from a key volume support level, and a bounce from a critical Fibonacci zone."

**ACTION 3: Plan the Trade**
1.  Select the **Trendline tool**.
2.  Draw a horizontal line for a potential entry.
3.  Draw another below the recent low for a stop-loss.
4.  Draw a third line near the Point of Control (POC) for a target.

> **SAY:** "At this point, we have a high-probability setup. We can use the drawing tools to map out our trade. We have our entry, our stop-loss is clearly defined below this recent swing low, and our primary target could be the Point of Control up here.
>
> "And that's the entire workflow. We went from a fully automated, 24/7 alert, to a deep, multi-factor analysis, to a fully planned trade with a clear risk-reward profile, all within about 90 seconds, without ever leaving the app. This is how the scanner helps traders act on high-probability setups with speed and confidence."
